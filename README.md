# Python-Programing-Final-Project
## Project Proposal
I would like to create an api that helps nba fans to analyze their favourite NBA player’s performance and help them enjoy the game.It will have methods to:
1. Take in an NBA player’s name and return basic info about this player which will include whether the player is an active player, as well as all the seasons he has played in his career and the teams he has played for and his career average. 
2. For active players, provide the schedule of upcoming games, and you can add it to your google calendar to remind you to watch the game.
3. Input a specific season to display the player's statistics for that season.
4. Input multiple seasons to compare the player's statistics across those seasons.
5. Input a ZIP code to find the nearest NBA arena and inform when the selected player will play there, along with a link to purchase tickets.

## Execution Plan
1. By the end of week 4, I'll set up basic api request by using nba.api and implement basic data storage with json module.
2. By the end of week 5, I will creat player search functionality and bulid a command-line interface.
3. By the end of week 6, I will implement game shcedule retrieval, and set up google calendar api access, and write python code to create calendar events.
4. By the end of week 7, I will implement statistics comparison, which will fetch player's season statistics and compare multiple seasons then calculate basic statistical differences.
5. By the end of week 8, I will add detailed docstings to all functions, and create error handling.
6. Finally, I will do the final test: test all features thoroughly and fix any bugs then prepare the project video.
